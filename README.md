# Kaggle-Project-Predict-dismission-rate

# This is a kaggle in-class competition, the description of the problem will be updated soon.

# For the problem, firstly I clean and vasualizing the data; 
# Then, I use classic machine learning models including but not limited LR, SVM, TPOT;
# After that, I try to ensemble the result using stacking, boosting and so on;
# Moreover, I also try to use feature engineering to create suitable new features (yet, the result is not perfect at that time)
# Finally, I tried cross-validation (k-fold) and other techniques to improve my results.

# In this document, I will update a report of my work;
# Then, three reviews will be updated focusing on the data clean, ensembling learning and feature engineering;
# In each review, I will try to expand the content not limiting what I use for the problems, but they are just for beginners.
